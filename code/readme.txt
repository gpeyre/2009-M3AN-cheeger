Cheeger selection.

A set of Matlab functions to compute maximal Cheeger sets.
It can handle:
* 2D and 3D shapes.
* Weighted L2 and weighted total variations.
* L2, L1 and Linf norms.
* Pseudo-multigrid computation to speed up the algorithm.

The algorithm is explained in the paper
    Approximation of Maximal Cheeger Sets by Projection
    Guillaume Carlier, Myriam Comte, Gabriel Peyré,
    Preprint, December 2007.

The main function is perform_tv_projection.
See test_xxx.m for examples.
